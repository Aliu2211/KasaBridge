            At KasaBridge, accessibility isn't just a featureâ€”it's our foundation. We believe that communication tools

          <p>
            Our application is designed with accessibility as a core principle, following WCAG guidelines and best
            practices to ensure that all users can navigate, understand, and interact with our platform effectively.
